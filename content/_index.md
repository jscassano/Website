subtitle: "Behavioral ecologist, data scientist, honeybee enthusiast"
description: My work is mainly focused on behavioral ecology with a strong emphasis on data analytics, mathematical modeling and data visualization. My current MS thesis seeks to understand evolutionary origins for phenotypic diversity inside a honeybee colony and broader relationships between behavior, physiology and life history traits in a social insect. I enjoy finding patterns in noisy, messy datasets and using multidimensional programming solutions to solve complex problems. I am also a fan of a healthy balance of outdoor activities, curating my indoor plants and traveling to exciting destinations.
