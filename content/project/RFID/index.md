title: Automated Monitoring Using Radio Frequency Identification (RFID)
subtitle: "Bees with backpacks"
author: Julian Cassano
excerpt: At the Honeybee Behavior Lab, we use automated monitoring to study honeybee foraging behavior. I often refer to this project as "bees with backpacks" because I essentially I equip my forager with high-tech backpacks that allow me to monitor them exiting and entering the hive.
