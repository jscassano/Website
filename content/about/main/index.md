  Hi! 
  
  My name is Julian Cassano and I am behavioral ecologist at Colorado State University in Fort Collins, CO. My journey as an academic researcher began in 2015 as an undergraduate researcher in the [Nieh Lab](https://labs.biology.ucsd.edu/nieh/index.html) where I studied honeybee learning and memory. My passion for research only grew when I decided to spend my last leg of undergrad studying abroad in the pristine cloud forests of Costa Rica. 
  
  After graduating, I moved to Boulder, Colorado to join a team of environmental educators at [Wild Bear Nature Center](https://www.wildbear.org/), a nonprofit education center in the front range mountains of CO. It was here that I developed my love for communicating science  and although I loved getting paid to romp around the Rockies, grad school was soon calling my name. 
  
  I am currently a Masters student at in the [Graduate Degree Program in Ecology](https://ecology.colostate.edu/) at Colorado State University researching honeybees in the [Social Behavior Lab](https://socialbehaviorlab.colostate.edu/group-members/). This journey has allowed me to develop not only my quantitative research skills, but also allowed me to pursue passions such as founding a [nonprofit](http://eco-ed.org/our-team/) focused on cutting-edge community outreach programs and starting a functional beverage company with some of my best friends.
