title: Automated Monitoring Using Radio Frequency Identification (RFID)
subtitle: "Bees with backpacks"
author: Julian Cassano
excerpt: At the Honeybee Behavior Lab, we use automated monitoring to study honeybee foraging behavior. I often refer to this project as "bees with backpacks" because I essentially I equip my forager with high-tech backpacks that allow me to monitor them exiting and entering the hive.

A glimpse into the busy lives bees!

This project utilizes automated Radio Frequency Identification methods to monitor foraging behavior for individuals honeybees. We start by fascinating our "bee backpacks" to newly hatched workers and re introducing them into an experimental colony. Next we set up RFID readers at the hive entrance and when the tagged individuals are old enough to leave the hive, we start collecting data! This project has challenged me manipulate large, noisy datasets (sometimes over a million entries!) and apply statistical techniques to make sense of it all.
